			The Sundarbans
		</div>
		<p>
			Located near Khulna, the Sundarbans mean it’s safari time! This mangrove forest is home to over 400 Royal Bengal tigers – you can sort out your safari from either Khulna or Dhaka. Expect to pay around $30 for everything, which is a great bargain considering what you may see. No guarantees on the tigers I’m afraid folks, but always worth the gamble!

			Cox’s Bazar
		</div>
		<p>
			The longest sea beach in the world! Over 120km long, what more could you ask for!? This place offers great respite from the madness of Bangladesh, and it’s dotted with religious sites too. The beaches get quite crowded and there’s plenty of accommodation to be found upon arrival.

		Bagerhat
		</div>
		<p>
			Accessible from Khulna or Mongla, Bagerhat offers a couple of impressive Mosques and the famous tomb of Khan Jahan Ali. Lots of locals make pilgrimages here daily so expect some organized chaos!
